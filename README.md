# Eth-AVAX-module_2

This is a web3 project that demonstrates the interaction of the smart contract with the front-end application.

## Description

This project aims to develop a basic decentralized application (DApp) by creating a smart contract with two to three essential functions.
Once the smart contract is deployed, a front-end interface will be developed using web development technologies like HTML, CSS. 
The front end will allow users to interact with the smart contract by triggering its functions and displaying the output in a clear and intuitive manner.

## Steps to do it 

Firstly we have created a simple web page using html, css and js. This webpage displays the token information in a well-defined manner. 
Then we have created a smart contract and deployed it on sepolia test-chain. This contract contains the token information and function for fetching the information.
Then we have created a new project on the alchemy which is a web3 provider. Using the api key, we are able to log all the transaction that take place on this 
network. Finally we extract the contract adress and the abi from the deployed contract and use them to call the functions for retrieving the information and 
then displaying in on the webpage.
